What I expect to Learn in this module: 
I expect to learn how to build a basic webiste from start to finish. By the end of the lesson, I will be able to: 

1. Create an html file with a boilerplate html code. 
2. House webpages and images in the appropriate directories. 
3. Write a recipe. 

What I actually learned from this module: 
1. I need to learn more about how to write commit messages. I don't feel like I have enough examples of basic commit messages. I hope to learn this skill by reading other people's commit messages. 
2. I need to commit often. 
3. Not making typos is important. 
4. Properly typing paths for images and links is very important. I tend to forget to go up the path from a folder initially. 
5. I understand how to write a boilerplate and link webpages together.
